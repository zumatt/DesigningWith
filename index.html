        <p>The aim of the project is to develop an experimental approach and collaborate on the definition of a new educational module suitable to be applied in multidisciplinary environments that integrate <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence" target="_blank">Artificial Intelligence</a> (AI) and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning" target="_blank">Machine Learning</a> (ML) in Design curricula. This website will provide an online toolkit containing AI/ML tools, resources and methodologies accessible by an audiance of design teachers and students with a traning background in different design areas.</p>
